# Traffic Density Estimation Using OpenCV

## Part 3 : Analysis of Runtime-Utility Trade-offs
<br>

### Executing Tester 
First build the executable using instructions given in the other README file.
``` bash
$ cd analysis
$ mkdir -p graphs
$ python3 tester.py k
``` 
Here, command line argument k can have 4 values 1, 2, 3 and 4 for methods 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively.

### Files description
- *analysis.pdf* - File that contains a report on the methods implemented and analysis of outputs and graphs.
- *tester.py* - Python script to produce graphs for nalysis of methods 1, 2, 3 and 4.
- *graphs* - Folder where all the plots of utility vs runtime analysis are saved by the script.
